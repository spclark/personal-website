			My personal website (what you're looking at right now)! Inspired by the
			design of the late 90's/early 2000's, I attempted to emulate the look and
			feel of Windows 98 in a way that would pay homage to the classic OS while
			providing a contemporary twist on the typical webpage interface.

				Alex Meub's website

			, with the exception of the menu bar buttons, GitHub, and LinkedIn icons,
			which I made myself.
